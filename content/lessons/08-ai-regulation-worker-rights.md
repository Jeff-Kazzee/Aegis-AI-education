- No discipline or termination based solely on AI decisions
- Workers have right to see their AI performance scores

**Microsoft-CWA Agreement (2025)**:
- 60-day advance notice before AI implementation affecting workers
- Human oversight required for all AI employment decisions
- Retraining provided when AI changes job requirements

**International Longshoremen's Association (2024)**:
- Prohibition on "fully automated" equipment at East and Gulf Coast ports
- Technology review committee with veto power over automation

### Template Union Language

**AI transparency**: "Workers have the right to know when AI systems are used to evaluate their performance, determine work assignments, or make employment decisions."

**Human oversight**: "No worker shall be subject to discipline, termination, or adverse employment action based solely on algorithmic decision-making without meaningful human review."

**Data access**: "Workers have the right to access their AI-generated scores, performance metrics, and the data used to create them."

## International Models: What's Possible
