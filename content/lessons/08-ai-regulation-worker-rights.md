# AI Regulation and Worker Rights: What's Actually Happening

Understanding your rights regarding AI in the workplace requires navigating a complex, rapidly changing legal landscape. As of July 2025, there's no comprehensive federal AI law, the Trump administration has rolled back worker protections, and states are moving ahead with their own regulations.

## Federal Level: Rollback and Retreat

### Trump Administration Changes (January 2025)

**Executive Order 14179** (January 23, 2025): Requires federal agencies to eliminate AI policies that "burden American innovation"

**Specific rollbacks**:
- EEOC removed AI employment discrimination guidance
- Department of Labor eliminated AI workplace monitoring standards  
- FTC scaled back AI bias enforcement
- OSHA withdrew AI workplace safety recommendations

**What this means**: Federal worker protections against AI discrimination and surveillance have been significantly weakened.

### What Federal Protection Remains

**Existing civil rights laws still apply**:
- Title VII (racial/gender discrimination)
- Americans with Disabilities Act
- Age Discrimination in Employment Act
- National Labor Relations Act (organizing rights)

**The challenge**: Without specific AI guidance, proving discrimination requires expensive technical analysis and legal interpretation.

**Current enforcement**: Relies on private lawsuits and state-level action rather than federal oversight.

## State-Level Leadership: Where Real Protection Exists

### California: Leading on Privacy and Surveillance

**California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) - Current**:
- Workers can request information about AI data collection
- Right to know what algorithms are used in employment decisions
- Can demand deletion of unnecessary personal data

**New California AI Surveillance Law (Effective January 1, 2025)**:
- 14-day written notice required before implementing workplace monitoring technology
- Employees can access and challenge AI-generated scores and evaluations
- Prohibition on AI monitoring of union organizing activities

**AB 1221 (Proposed 2025)**: Would require 30-day notice for AI monitoring tools and give workers right to human review.

### Colorado: Comprehensive AI Regulation

**Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act (CAIA) - Effective February 1, 2026**:

**Bias audits required**: Employers must test AI systems for discrimination before deployment

**Worker notification**: Must disclose when AI is used for hiring, promotion, or termination decisions

**Right to explanation**: Workers can request information about how AI systems make decisions affecting them

**Reasonable care duty**: Employers legally responsible for preventing algorithmic discrimination

**Penalties**: Up to $20,000 per violation, with potential class action liability

### Illinois: Employment-Focused Protection

**Illinois Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act (Expanded 2025)**:
- Employers must notify candidates when AI analyzes video interviews
- Must explain how AI evaluation works
- Candidates can request human-only evaluation process

**AI Employment Law (Effective January 1, 2026)**:
- Broad notification requirements for AI in hiring and promotion
- Right to request alternative selection process without AI
- Protection against retaliation for challenging AI decisions

### Texas: Potential Comprehensive Framework

**HB 1709 (Potential September 2025 effective date)**:
- Comprehensive AI governance framework including employment provisions
- Bias testing requirements for high-risk AI applications
- Worker consultation requirements before AI implementation

## Legal Victories: Court Cases Setting Precedents

### Workday Collective Action (May 2025)

**Significance**: First federal court to allow nationwide class action against AI employment discrimination

**Key ruling**: "Drawing an artificial distinction between software decision-makers and human decision-makers would potentially gut anti-discrimination laws"

**Impact**: Establishes that existing civil rights laws fully apply to AI systems

**Current status**: Nationwide class certification approved; damages phase ongoing

### iTutorGroup Settlement (2025)

**First EEOC AI settlement**: $365,000 for programming AI to automatically reject applicants over 40

**Precedent**: Age discrimination laws apply to AI systems just as they do to human decisions

**Broader impact**: Signals EEOC will pursue AI discrimination cases despite reduced federal guidance

## Union Contract Victories

### Successful AI Contract Language

**UPS Teamsters (2023)**:
- Technology review committee must evaluate AI before implementation
- No discipline or termination based solely on AI decisions
- Workers have right to see their AI performance scores

**Microsoft-CWA Agreement (2025)**:
- 60-day advance notice before AI implementation affecting workers
- Human oversight required for all AI employment decisions
- Retraining provided when AI changes job requirements

**International Longshoremen's Association (2024)**:
- Prohibition on "fully automated" equipment at East and Gulf Coast ports
- Technology review committee with veto power over automation

### Template Union Language

**AI transparency**: "Workers have the right to know when AI systems are used to evaluate their performance, determine work assignments, or make employment decisions."

**Human oversight**: "No worker shall be subject to discipline, termination, or adverse employment action based solely on algorithmic decision-making without meaningful human review."

**Data access**: "Workers have the right to access their AI-generated scores, performance metrics, and the data used to create them."

## International Models: What's Possible

### European Union AI Act (Effective August 2024)

**Employment AI as "high-risk"**: Requires strict oversight, bias testing, and human review

**Worker rights**:
- Right to explanation for AI decisions
- Right to human review of algorithmic decisions
- Prohibition on AI systems that manipulate behavior

**Penalties**: Up to 6% of global annual revenue for violations

### United Kingdom Developments

**Trade Union Congress AI Bill**: Proposed legislation requiring worker consultation before high-risk AI deployment

**Equality and Human Rights Commission**: Guidance on preventing AI discrimination in employment

**Voluntary corporate standards**: Several companies adopted algorithmic transparency policies after union pressure

## Know Your Current Rights (Limited as They Are)

### Federal Rights That Still Exist

**National Labor Relations Act**: Right to organize and discuss AI workplace issues with coworkers

**Civil rights laws**: Protection against AI discrimination based on race, gender, age, disability

**Occupational safety**: Right to workplace free from AI-created safety hazards

### State-Specific Rights

**California workers**:
- Right to know about AI data collection
- Right to challenge AI surveillance decisions
- Protection of union organizing from AI monitoring

**New York City workers**:
- Right to disclosure of AI use in hiring (Local Law 144)
- Right to request bias audit results

**Future state protections** (Colorado, Illinois, Texas):
- Right to human review of AI decisions
- Right to explanation of AI factors in employment decisions
- Protection against retaliation for challenging AI bias

## What You Can Do: Practical Steps

### Document AI Use and Bias

**Keep records**:
- When AI systems are used in employment decisions affecting you
- Patterns of AI bias you observe
- Requests for human review and responses
- Differences in how AI treats different groups of workers

**Use available rights**: In California, request your AI data under CCPA

### File Complaints When Appropriate

**EEOC complaints**: Still possible for AI discrimination under existing civil rights laws

**State civil rights agencies**: Often more responsive than federal agencies

**Labor boards**: For AI surveillance that interferes with organizing

**Class action opportunities**: Join existing cases like Workday litigation

### Collective Action Strategies

**Workplace organizing**: Build support among coworkers for AI transparency and oversight

**Union organizing**: Use AI issues as organizing opportunities

**Contract bargaining**: Push for AI provisions in union contracts

**Legislative advocacy**: Support state and local AI worker protection laws

## Red Flags: When Employers Violate Current Law

Even with limited federal protection, employers may be breaking existing laws if they:

**Use AI to discriminate** based on protected characteristics (race, gender, age, disability)

**Retaliate against workers** who challenge AI decisions or organize around AI issues

**Fail to provide disability accommodations** in AI-powered performance systems

**Use AI surveillance** that interferes with union organizing activities

**Implement AI safety systems** without considering occupational safety requirements

## The Enforcement Gap and How to Bridge It

### Why Enforcement Is Weak

**Technical complexity**: Government agencies lack expertise to investigate AI systems

**Resource constraints**: Limited staff and funding for AI oversight

**Corporate resistance**: Companies claim AI systems are proprietary trade secrets

**Legal uncertainty**: Without clear AI laws, enforcement relies on legal interpretation

### Building Enforcement Capacity

**Worker education**: Knowing your rights helps identify violations

**Collective documentation**: Multiple workers reporting patterns strengthens cases

**Legal support**: Civil rights organizations increasingly taking AI discrimination cases

**Public pressure**: Media attention and community organizing can force corporate accountability

## Looking Ahead: 2025-2026 Changes

### State Laws Taking Effect

**Colorado CAIA (February 2026)**: Most comprehensive state AI employment law

**Illinois AI Employment Law (January 2026)**: Strong notification and review rights

**Potential federal changes**: Possible congressional action if state laws create business pressure

### Union Strategy Evolution

**Industry-wide bargaining**: Multiple unions coordinating AI contract language

**Political action**: Unions increasingly lobbying for AI worker protection laws

**International coordination**: Learning from European and Canadian union AI strategies

## The Bottom Line

AI worker protection currently depends more on state laws, union contracts, and collective action than federal oversight. The Trump administration's rollback of federal protections makes state-level advocacy and workplace organizing even more important.

Your rights vary significantly by location and employment status. Understanding your specific state's laws and using available protections is essential for challenging AI bias and surveillance.
