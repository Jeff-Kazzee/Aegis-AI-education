# Evaluating AI Tools: What Actually Helps vs. Marketing

Now that you understand what AI can and cannot do, let's develop practical skills for evaluating AI tools. Whether you're choosing tools for yourself or your employer is considering AI implementation, you need frameworks for separating genuinely useful tools from expensive marketing schemes.

## The AI Tool Reality Check Framework

### The 2025 Productivity Data

Before examining specific tools, let's establish what "productivity gains" actually look like:

**Average real-world AI benefits**:
- **3% time savings** per work week (not the 40% claimed)
- **15% faster first drafts** (but same total project time due to editing needs)
- **19% slower performance** for experienced professionals due to error correction
- **5-10x higher implementation costs** than initially projected

**Key insight**: AI tools work best for routine, predictable tasks where quality control is manageable.

### The Cost-Benefit Analysis Questions

Before adopting any AI tool, ask:

1. **What specific task does this solve?** (Avoid tools that claim to "revolutionize everything")
2. **What's the error rate and who fixes mistakes?** (Factor correction time into productivity calculations)
3. **What's the total cost?** (Include subscription, training, integration, and maintenance)
4. **How does this compare to current methods?** (Sometimes existing tools work better)
5. **Who benefits most from this purchase?** (Tool vendor, management, or workers?)

## Current AI Tools: What Works and What Doesn't

### Text and Writing Tools

**GPT-4o (OpenAI) - Free Tier**
- **Best for**: First drafts, brainstorming, basic email templates
- **Cost**: Free (with usage limits)
- **Reality check**: Output needs significant editing; good for overcoming writer's block
- **Verdict**: **Worth trying** - free tier lets you test without commitment

**Claude 4 Sonnet (Anthropic)**
- **Best for**: Long document analysis, coding, structured data work
- **Cost**: $20/month personal, much higher for business
- **Reality check**: 20x more expensive than Gemini for marginally better performance
- **Verdict**: **Only if you need specific capabilities** - not worth the premium for most users

**Grammarly AI**
- **Best for**: Grammar checking, tone adjustment
- **Cost**: $12-15/month
- **Reality check**: AI features add little value over traditional grammar checking
- **Verdict**: **Traditional Grammarly is sufficient** - AI upgrade not worth the cost

### Code and Development Tools

**GitHub Copilot**
- **Best for**: Boilerplate code, common programming patterns
- **Cost**: $10/month individual, $19/month business
- **Reality check**: Experienced developers report 19% slower performance due to debugging AI suggestions
- **Verdict**: **Useful for beginners, questionable for experts** - try free trial first

**DeepSeek Coder (Open Source)**
- **Best for**: Basic coding assistance without subscription costs
- **Cost**: Free (open source)
- **Reality check**: Performance similar to paid tools for many tasks
- **Verdict**: **Worth trying** - no cost, no vendor lock-in

### Design and Creative Tools

**Canva AI**
- **Best for**: Quick social media graphics, basic design templates
- **Cost**: $15/month for AI features
- **Reality check**: Saves time on routine graphics but output looks generic
- **Verdict**: **Useful for non-designers** - but traditional design tools often better for professional work

**Adobe Firefly**
- **Best for**: Image generation integrated with professional tools
- **Cost**: Included with Creative Cloud subscription
- **Reality check**: Good for ideation, but final designs usually need human refinement
- **Verdict**: **Worthwhile if already using Adobe** - don't subscribe just for AI features

### Productivity and Organization Tools

**Notion AI**
- **Best for**: Meeting summaries, content organization
- **Cost**: $8-10/month per user
- **Reality check**: Most useful features could be done with templates and manual effort
- **Verdict**: **Nice to have, not essential** - evaluate based on your current Notion usage

**Microsoft Copilot (Office 365)**
- **Best for**: Document drafts, email composition, meeting summaries
- **Cost**: $30/month per user (business)
- **Reality check**: Genuine time savings for routine office tasks
- **Verdict**: **Worth considering for heavy Office users** - but expensive for individuals

## Red Flags: When AI Tools Are Likely Scams

### Warning Signs in Marketing

**"Revolutionary breakthrough"**: Real AI improvements are incremental
**Vague productivity claims**: "Increase productivity by 40%" without specifics
**"Eliminates human error"**: AI creates different errors, not fewer
**"AI that thinks like humans"**: Current AI doesn't think at all
**"One tool for everything"**: Specialized tools usually work better

### Pricing Red Flags

**"Enterprise pricing available on request"**: Usually means extremely expensive
**Seat-based pricing for AI tools**: Usage-based pricing is more cost-effective
**No free trial or money-back guarantee**: Confident vendors offer trials
**Sudden price increases**: Many AI tools raised prices 200-500% in 2024-2025

### Technical Red Flags

**Proprietary AI models with no benchmarks**: Transparent tools publish performance data
**"AI-powered" everything**: Often just traditional software with AI marketing
**No human oversight options**: Good AI tools include human review features
**Can't export your data**: Avoid vendor lock-in situations

**Avoid**: AI tutoring systems without human oversight
**Reality**: Academic integrity concerns limit implementation

### Customer Service

**Useful**: FAQ automation, ticket routing
**Avoid**: AI-only customer support for complex issues
**Reality**: Customer satisfaction drops without human escalation options

### Manufacturing

**Useful**: Predictive maintenance, quality control analysis
**Avoid**: Full automation promises
**Reality**: Human oversight essential for safety and flexibility

## Cost Analysis Framework

### Calculate True Implementation Costs

**Direct costs**:
- Subscription fees
- Usage-based charges
- Integration costs
- Training time

**Hidden costs**:
- Error correction time
- Quality control processes
- Change management
- Backup systems when AI fails

**Opportunity costs**:
- Time spent learning new tools
- Productivity lost during transition
- Alternative tools not pursued

### ROI Calculation Template

1. **Baseline productivity**: How long does the task take currently?
2. **AI-assisted time**: How long with AI (including error correction)?
3. **Implementation time**: Setup, training, integration
4. **Monthly costs**: All fees and usage charges
5. **Break-even point**: When does time savings offset costs?

**Example**: Email drafting tool
- Current time: 30 minutes per complex email
- AI-assisted time: 20 minutes (including editing)
- Monthly emails: 20
- Time saved: 200 minutes per month
- Tool cost: $20/month
- Your hourly value: $30
- ROI: Saves $100 worth of time for $20 cost = 400% return

## Questions to Ask Before Adopting AI Tools

### For Individual Users

- Can I try this free or with a money-back guarantee?
- Does this solve a specific problem I actually have?
- Am I choosing this tool or is it being forced on me?
- What happens to my data if I stop using this tool?
- Is there a simpler, cheaper alternative?

### For Workplace Implementation

- What specific business problem does this solve?
- How will success be measured beyond cost savings?
- What training and support will workers receive?
- Who is responsible when the AI makes mistakes?
- How will this affect worker job security and roles?

### For Union Contracts

- Will workers have input on AI tool selection?
- What retraining will be provided?
- How will productivity metrics change?
- What protections exist against AI-based discipline?
- Can workers opt out of AI monitoring features?

## The Bottom Line: A Skeptical Approach

**Most AI tools are not worth their cost** for individual users. The marketing promises rarely match reality, and free alternatives often work nearly as well.

**For businesses**: AI tools can provide value, but only with realistic expectations, proper training, and human oversight. Most successful implementations focus on narrow, specific tasks rather than broad "transformation."

**For workers**: Push for transparency about AI tool costs and benefits. Demand training and input on implementation. Remember that your expertise and judgment remain more valuable than any AI tool.

In the next lesson, we'll examine how AI systems perpetuate and amplify bias and discrimination in the workplace, using current examples and legal cases.
