# What AI Actually Is (And Isn't)

Now that you can spot AI hype, let's build a solid understanding of what AI systems actually do. This isn't about becoming a programmer—it's about having enough technical knowledge to evaluate AI claims critically and understand what's realistic to expect from the models available in July 2025.

## The Current AI Landscape: What's Actually Available

As of July 2025, the AI you hear about most consists of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**—sophisticated pattern-matching systems trained on massive amounts of text and images.

### The Big Players (July 2025)

**Claude 4 Family (Anthropic)**
- **What it is**: Text processing with 200,000 token context (about 150,000 words)
- **What it's good at**: Long document analysis, coding, structured data work
- **Cost reality**: Claude 4 Sonnet costs 20x more than Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Limitation**: Still makes up information when uncertain

**GPT-4o and Reasoning Models (OpenAI)**
- **GPT-4o**: Available on free tier, decent all-around performance
- **o3/o4-mini**: "Reasoning" models that take longer to think through problems
- **What changed**: Better at math and coding, still can't browse the internet reliably
- **Cost**: $3 per million input tokens, $10 per million output tokens

**Gemini 2.5 (Google)**
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Multimodal (text, images, video)
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash**: Optimized for speed, sub-second responses
- **Advantage**: Tight Google ecosystem integration
- **Reality**: Most cost-effective for high-volume basic tasks

**DeepSeek-R1 (The Disruptor)**
- **What it is**: Open-weight model achieving GPT-4 level performance
- **Cost advantage**: 1/10th the price of comparable models
- **Significance**: Proves expensive doesn't mean better

## How These Systems Actually Work

### Pattern Matching, Not Thinking

Current AI models are extremely sophisticated **autocomplete systems**. They predict what word comes next based on patterns they learned from training data.

**Simple Example**: 
- You type: "The capital of France is..."
- AI predicts: "Paris" (because that pattern appeared millions of times in training)

**Complex Example**:
- You ask: "Write a performance review for an employee"
- AI combines patterns from thousands of performance reviews to generate something that sounds right

### What This Means for You

**AI is good at**:
- Tasks that follow predictable patterns
- Combining existing information in new ways
- Generating first drafts that humans then edit
- Processing large amounts of text quickly

**AI struggles with**:
- Completely novel situations not in training data
- Tasks requiring real-world verification
- Understanding context beyond what's explicitly stated
- Distinguishing between plausible-sounding and accurate information

## Current Capabilities vs. Marketing Claims

### What AI Can Actually Do (July 2025)

**Document Processing**: Summarize reports, extract key information, format data
- **Example**: Turn a 50-page manual into a 2-page summary
- **Limitation**: May miss nuanced context or critical details

**Code Assistance**: Generate boilerplate code, explain existing code, suggest improvements
- **Example**: Write basic functions for common programming tasks
- **Limitation**: Experienced developers report 19% slower performance due to debugging AI errors

**Customer Service**: Handle routine inquiries, escalate complex issues
- **Example**: Answer FAQ questions, process standard requests
- **Limitation**: Customer satisfaction drops when AI handles complex problems

**Content Creation**: Generate first drafts, brainstorm ideas, create variations
- **Example**: Write email templates, social media posts, basic articles
- **Limitation**: Output sounds generic without significant human editing

### What AI Cannot Do (Despite Claims)

**Replace Human Judgment**: AI cannot make ethical decisions, understand stakeholder impact, or navigate complex interpersonal situations.

**Eliminate Bias**: AI amplifies biases in training data and creates new forms of discrimination.

**Understand Context**: AI doesn't truly understand what it's processing—it matches patterns without comprehension.

**Verify Information**: AI cannot fact-check itself or distinguish between accurate and plausible-sounding but false information.

## The "Reasoning" Models Explained

In 2025, companies introduced "reasoning" models (OpenAI's o3, Claude's Extended Thinking) that supposedly "think" through problems.

### What's Actually Happening

These models don't reason like humans. They:
1. Generate multiple approaches to a problem
2. Check their work against patterns in training data
3. Refine their answers through iteration
4. Present the final result

### Why This Matters

**Useful for**: Math problems, coding challenges, structured analysis
**Still limited by**: Training data patterns, inability to verify real-world information
**Cost reality**: Takes 3-10x longer and costs much more than regular AI

## Multimodal AI: Images, Video, Audio

Current AI can process more than just text, but with significant limitations.

### Image Processing (July 2025)

**What it can do**:
- Describe images accurately
- Extract text from photos
- Generate images from descriptions
- Identify objects and scenes

**What it cannot do**:
- Understand complex visual context
- Reliably identify specific individuals
- Process images requiring specialized expertise (medical scans, technical diagrams)

### Video and Audio

**Video**: Basic scene description, simple editing tasks
**Audio**: Speech-to-text, music generation, voice cloning
**Limitations**: High computational costs, inconsistent quality, ethical concerns with deepfakes

## The Technical Reality Behind AI "Intelligence"

### No Understanding, Just Prediction

AI systems don't understand language the way humans do. They:
- Calculate probabilities for word sequences
- Match input patterns to training examples
- Generate statistically likely responses
- Cannot truly comprehend meaning or context

### Training Data Determines Everything

An AI model is only as good as its training data:
- **Garbage in, garbage out**: Biased data creates biased outputs
- **Training cutoffs**: Models don't know about events after training
- **Pattern limitations**: Cannot handle situations not represented in training

### Hallucination: A Feature, Not a Bug

AI models "hallucinate"—generate confident-sounding but false information—because they're designed to always produce output, even when they don't have accurate information.

**Example**: Ask AI about a person who doesn't exist, and it will confidently describe their career, achievements, and personal life.

## What This Means for Workers

### Realistic Expectations

**AI is a tool**, like a calculator or word processor, that can assist with specific tasks but requires human oversight and judgment.

**Good uses**:
- First drafts that you heavily edit
- Processing routine information
- Organizing large amounts of data
- Generating ideas for human evaluation

**Poor uses**:
- Making important decisions without human review
- Tasks requiring accuracy you cannot verify
- Situations involving complex human factors
- Anything with legal, ethical, or safety implications

### Cost-Benefit Reality

Most AI implementations cost 5-10 times more than initially projected when you factor in:
- Software licensing and usage fees
- Training time for workers
- Quality control and error correction
- Integration with existing systems
- Ongoing maintenance and updates

## Red Flags: When Companies Misrepresent AI

Watch for these warning signs:
- Claims that AI "understands" or "thinks"
- Promises of human-level performance without human oversight
- Vague productivity improvements without specific metrics
- Suggestions that AI can replace complex human judgment
- Marketing that ignores error rates or implementation costs

## The Bottom Line

Current AI models are impressive pattern-matching tools that can assist with many tasks, but they're not the revolutionary intelligence that marketing claims suggest. Understanding their actual capabilities—and limitations—helps you make informed decisions about when and how to use them.

In the next lesson, we'll examine how these technical realities translate to real workplace impacts, using data from actual AI implementations in 2025.
