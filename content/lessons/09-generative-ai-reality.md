## What Generative AI Cannot Do (Despite Claims)

### Fundamental Limitations

**Verify information**: AI cannot fact-check itself or distinguish accurate from plausible-sounding information

**Replace expertise**: AI lacks domain knowledge and context that comes from experience

**Make ethical judgments**: AI cannot weigh moral considerations or stakeholder impacts

**Understand context**: AI processes text patterns without comprehending meaning or implications

### Specific Task Failures

**Complex analysis requiring accuracy**: Legal research, medical diagnosis, financial planning

**Original creative work**: AI recombines existing patterns; true creativity requires human insight

**Real-time information**: Most models have training cutoffs and cannot access current events

**Interpersonal communication**: AI cannot navigate complex human relationships or organizational politics

## The Quality Control Problem

### Why AI Output Requires Heavy Editing

**Generic voice**: AI content sounds formulaic and lacks authentic personality

**Factual errors**: AI confidently states incorrect information

**Context blindness**: AI misses nuances specific to your situation or audience

**Cultural insensitivity**: AI training reflects biases and assumptions that may not match your values

### Real-World Content Quality

**Study results**: Most AI-generated content requires 40-60% revision to reach professional quality

**User reports**: Initial drafts are faster, but total project time often remains the same due to editing requirements

**Brand consistency**: AI output lacks the specific voice and style that defines professional communication

## Cost-Benefit Analysis for Common Uses

### Email and Communication

**Time savings**: 15-20% faster initial drafts
