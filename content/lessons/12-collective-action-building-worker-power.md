# Collective Action and AI: Building Worker Power

Individual workers have limited power against AI systems designed to benefit employers. But collective action—through unions, workplace organizing, and coordinated advocacy—has already won significant victories. This lesson shows you how workers are building power around AI and how you can apply these strategies.

## Major Union Victories: Proof That Organizing Works

### Hollywood Strikes: Setting the Template (2023)

**Writers Guild of America (WGA) Victory**:
- **148-day strike** shut down major productions until studios agreed to AI limitations
- **Contract language**: AI cannot write or rewrite literary material; AI output cannot be source material
- **Human oversight**: Writers must approve any AI use in their projects
- **Compensation protection**: Writers paid full rates even when AI assists with development

**Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) Victory**:
- **Consent requirements**: AI cannot replicate actor performances without explicit consent
- **Compensation guarantee**: Actors paid for AI use of their likeness
- **Notification rights**: Actors must be informed when AI is used in production

**Why these victories matter**: Established that workers can negotiate specific contract language limiting AI use and ensuring human oversight.

### Longshoremen's Direct Action: Stopping Automation (2024)

**International Longshoremen's Association (ILA)**:
- **3-day strike** shut down East and Gulf Coast ports in October 2024
- **Victory**: Won agreement prohibiting "fully automated" technology at ports
- **Contract language**: All cargo handling equipment must have human operators
- **Technology committee**: Union review required before implementing new automation

**Impact**: Showed that strategic strikes can stop AI/automation implementation when workers organize collectively.

### Teamsters Technology Victories

**UPS Contract (2023)**:
- **Technology review committee** must evaluate new monitoring systems before implementation
- **Data access rights**: Workers can see their own AI-generated performance data
- **Human oversight**: Prohibits discipline or termination based solely on AI decisions
- **Training guarantee**: Company must provide training when technology changes job requirements

**Broader Teamsters strategy**: Negotiating similar language across logistics and transportation industry.

## Tech Sector Organizing: Workers Refusing to Build Surveillance

### Microsoft-CWA Partnership (2025)

**Groundbreaking agreement** between Microsoft and Communications Workers of America:
- **60-day advance notice** before implementing AI systems affecting workers
