# Protecting Yourself in an AI Workplace

As AI systems become more common in workplaces, protecting yourself requires understanding your limited rights, using available legal protections, and building collective power with coworkers. This lesson provides practical strategies you can use immediately.

## Know Your Rights (State by State)

### California Workers: Strongest Protections

**California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) Rights**:
- Request information about AI data collection
- Access your AI-generated scores and performance metrics
- Demand corrections to inaccurate AI data
- Request deletion of unnecessary personal information

**How to use CCPA**: Send written request to your employer's privacy officer citing specific CCPA rights. They must respond within 45 days.

**New surveillance protections (2025)**: 14-day written notice required before implementing AI monitoring technology.

### Colorado Workers: Comprehensive AI Rights (Starting February 2026)

**Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act rights**:
- Right to know when AI is used in employment decisions
- Right to explanation of AI factors affecting you
- Right to human review of algorithmic decisions
- Protection against retaliation for challenging AI bias

### Illinois Workers: Employment-Focused Protection (Starting January 2026)

**AI Employment Law rights**:
- Notification when AI makes employment decisions
- Right to request alternative selection process without AI
- Protection against AI discrimination in hiring and promotion

### New York City Workers

**Local Law 144 rights**:
- Disclosure of AI use in hiring processes
- Access to AI bias audit results
- Right to request alternative selection process

### All Other States: Federal Law Protection Only

**Civil rights protections still apply**:
- Title VII (race, gender, religion, national origin discrimination)
- Americans with Disabilities Act
- Age Discrimination in Employment Act
- National Labor Relations Act (organizing rights)

**Challenge**: Without specific AI guidance, you need extensive documentation and legal help to prove discrimination.

## Practical Privacy Protection Strategies

### Assume Complete Surveillance on Company Systems

**Email and messaging**: Avoid discussing sensitive topics (union organizing, job searches, personal issues) on company email or Slack

**Company devices**: Use personal devices for personal communications, job searches, and organizing activities

**Internet usage**: Assume all browsing on company networks is monitored and analyzed

**Physical surveillance**: Be aware that AI systems may analyze video feeds, badge swipes, and parking lot data

### Strategic Communication Practices

**Professional communications only**: Keep work communications focused on job tasks
**Avoid informal discussions**: AI systems may misinterpret casual conversation as performance issues
**Document requests**: When asking for information about AI systems, do so in writing
**Copy yourself**: Send important communications to your personal email for records

### Data Protection Tactics

**Personal information limits**: Minimize sharing personal information that AI systems could use for discrimination
**Social media awareness**: Employers may use AI to analyze public social media profiles
**Location privacy**: Turn off location services on company devices when possible
**Biometric data**: Understand what biometric data (fingerprints, facial recognition) your employer collects

## Documenting AI Bias and Unfair Treatment

### What to Document

**AI-driven decisions affecting you**:
- Hiring, promotion, performance evaluation, or discipline decisions
- Work assignments or scheduling changes
- Training opportunities or access to resources
- Any mention that AI systems influenced decisions about you

**Patterns of differential treatment**:
- How AI systems treat different groups of workers
- Inconsistent application of AI-generated policies
- Workers with similar qualifications receiving different AI-generated outcomes

**Requests and responses**:
- Requests for human review of AI decisions
- Requests for information about AI systems
- Employer responses to AI-related concerns

### Documentation Best Practices

**Date and time**: Record when AI-related incidents occur
**Witnesses**: Note who else was present or affected
**Screenshots**: Capture AI-generated communications or decisions when possible
**Follow-up in writing**: Confirm verbal conversations about AI issues in writing
**Personal copies**: Keep documentation on personal devices or cloud storage

### Creating a Paper Trail

**Email requests**: "Could you please explain how the AI system determined my performance rating?"
**Meeting follow-ups**: "As we discussed, I'm requesting human review of the AI hiring decision"
**Incident reports**: "I'm documenting what appears to be inconsistent AI treatment of similar situations"

## Challenging AI Decisions

### Internal Company Processes

**Request human review**: Most companies have (or should have) processes for human review of AI decisions
**Use grievance procedures**: File formal complaints through HR or union grievance processes
**Escalate systematically**: Document each level of internal review and response

**Template language**: "I am requesting human review of this AI-generated decision as provided under [company policy/state law]. Please provide written explanation of the factors that led to this decision."

### External Complaint Options

**EEOC complaints**: File discrimination complaints if AI systems show bias based on protected characteristics
**State civil rights agencies**: Often more responsive than federal agencies
**Labor board complaints**: If AI systems interfere with organizing or union activities
**State attorneys general**: Some states investigating AI employment discrimination

### Class Action Opportunities

**Join existing lawsuits**: Workday collective action shows success of group challenges
**Document group impact**: AI bias often affects multiple workers similarly
**Connect with legal advocates**: Civil rights organizations increasingly taking AI discrimination cases

## Building Collective Power Around AI

### Workplace Organizing Strategies

**Information gathering**: Work with colleagues to document AI systems in use
**Collective concerns**: Identify shared problems with AI implementation
**Group requests**: Multiple workers requesting AI transparency is more effective than individual requests
**Policy advocacy**: Push for workplace policies limiting AI surveillance and requiring human oversight

### Union Organizing Around AI

**AI as organizing issue**: Use AI concerns to build support for union representation
**Contract negotiations**: Push for AI transparency, human oversight, and worker consultation
**Grievance procedures**: Use union contracts to challenge unfair AI decisions
**Political advocacy**: Support legislation protecting workers from AI discrimination

### Successful Union Contract Language Examples

**UPS Teamsters**: "No worker shall be disciplined or discharged based solely on information obtained through electronic monitoring or AI systems without human review."

**Microsoft-CWA**: "The Company will provide 60 days advance notice before implementing AI systems that affect workers' employment, working conditions, or job duties."

**Template language**: "Workers have the right to know when AI systems are used to evaluate their performance and to request human review of AI decisions."

## Legal Challenge Strategies

### When to Consult a Lawyer

**Clear discrimination patterns**: AI systems consistently treating protected groups differently
**Retaliation**: Employer punishment for challenging AI decisions or organizing around AI issues
**Privacy violations**: AI surveillance that violates state privacy laws
**Disability discrimination**: AI systems that fail to accommodate workers with disabilities

### Types of Legal Claims

**Employment discrimination**: AI bias based on race, gender, age, disability, or other protected characteristics
**Privacy violations**: Unlawful surveillance or data collection under state privacy laws
**Retaliation**: Punishment for exercising rights to challenge AI systems
**Breach of contract**: Violation of union contracts requiring human oversight

### Building Strong Legal Cases

**Group impact**: AI discrimination often affects multiple workers, strengthening legal claims
**Expert testimony**: Technical experts can analyze AI systems for bias and discrimination
**Comparative evidence**: Showing how AI treats similar workers differently
**Company knowledge**: Evidence that employers knew AI systems were discriminatory

## Protecting Coworkers and Building Solidarity

### Collective Information Sharing

**Share experiences**: Discuss AI impacts with trusted coworkers
**Compare treatment**: Identify patterns of AI bias affecting different workers
**Resource sharing**: Share information about legal rights and complaint procedures
**Mutual support**: Help coworkers document AI bias and navigate complaint processes

### Building Workplace Campaigns

**Petition drives**: Collective requests for AI transparency and human oversight
**Meeting attendance**: Show up together for meetings about AI implementation
**Media strategy**: Public pressure can force companies to address AI problems
**Coalition building**: Connect with community organizations concerned about AI impact

## The Bottom Line: You Have More Power Than You Think

While legal protections against AI discrimination and surveillance are limited, you're not powerless. Combining individual documentation and legal strategies with collective action creates the strongest protection against AI exploitation.

**Remember**:
- Document everything related to AI decisions affecting you
- Use available state law protections to request information and human review
- Work with coworkers to identify patterns and build collective responses
- Challenge AI bias through internal processes, external complaints, and legal action
- Focus on building long-term power through organizing and policy advocacy

The goal isn't to eliminate AI from workplaces, but to ensure AI systems serve workers' interests rather than just management efficiency and cost-cutting.
