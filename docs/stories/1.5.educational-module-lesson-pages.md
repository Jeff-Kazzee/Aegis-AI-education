## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.1: Next.js project with Markdown processing capabilities (gray-matter, remark)
- Story 1.2: Header/Footer layout with "Course" navigation link routing to /course
- Stories 1.3-1.4: Patterns established for page creation and responsive design

### Data Model Requirements
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
**Lesson Data Model:**
```typescript
interface Lesson {
  slug: string;       // URL-friendly identifier from filename
  title: string;      // Lesson title from Markdown frontmatter
  order: number;      // Numeric value for sequencing
  content: string;    // Main lesson body parsed from Markdown to HTML
  excerpt: string;    // Optional summary from frontmatter
}
```

### Content Processing Technology
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Content Parsing**: gray-matter 4.0.x, remark 15.0.x - Standard libraries for Markdown processing
- **Purpose**: Parse Markdown files into HTML and extract metadata (frontmatter)
- **Requirement**: Required for FR1 (educational content display)

### Project Structure for Content
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
Required structure for educational content:
```
content/
└── lessons/
    ├── 01-introduction.md        <- Sample lesson files
    └── 02-another-lesson.md

src/
├── app/
│   ├── (pages)/
│   │   └── course/
│   │       ├── [slug]/
│   │       │   └── page.tsx     <- Individual lesson pages
│   │       └── page.tsx         <- Course overview page
└── lib/
    └── lessons.ts               <- Content processing utility
```

### Functional Requirements
[Source: prd/requirements.md - FR1]
- **FR1**: Platform must display educational content, organized as series of posts or course module
- Content must be organized and easily navigable
- Must support modular lesson structure
- Local Markdown files enable easy content editing

### UI/UX Design Requirements for Educational Content
[Source: prd/user-interface-design-goals.md]
- **Content Focus**: Heavily focused on readability for educational material
- **Design Vision**: Calm, educational, supportive space free of distractions
- **Navigation**: Simple and predictable for learning flow
- **Typography**: Highly readable typography as core focus
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA standards for educational accessibility
- **Experience**: Similar to well-designed documentation site

### Content Service Architecture
[Source: architecture/components.md]
- **Content Service (Local)**: Logical service responsible for reading and parsing lesson data from local Markdown files
- Service provides structured Lesson objects to WebApp
- Must integrate seamlessly with Next.js page generation

### Technology Stack for Content Pages
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2.x - SSG (Static Site Generation) for lesson content
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.4.x - Type safety for lesson data structures
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.x - Typography-focused styling for readability
- **Content**: Local Markdown files with frontmatter metadata

### Static Site Generation (SSG) Requirements
- Use Next.js SSG for optimal performance of educational content
- Pre-render all lesson pages at build time
- Generate lesson navigation automatically from content directory
- Ensure fast loading for educational experience

### Navigation Requirements
- **Course Overview**: List all lessons with titles and excerpts
- **Lesson Navigation**: Previous/Next links for sequential learning
- **Edge Cases**: Handle first lesson (no Previous) and last lesson (no Next)
- **Accessibility**: Clear navigation with proper ARIA labels

### Content Structure Guidelines
Markdown files should include frontmatter:
```yaml
---
title: "Lesson Title"
order: 1
excerpt: "Brief lesson summary"
---
# Lesson Content Here
```

### Accessibility Requirements for Educational Content
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1 for lesson title, h2+ for sections)
- Semantic HTML for lesson content structure
- High contrast ratios for text readability
- Keyboard navigation for lesson sequences
- Screen reader optimization for educational content
- Focus management between lessons

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Content Testing**: Test Markdown parsing and lesson data extraction
- **Page Testing**: Test lesson page rendering and navigation
- **Accessibility Testing**: Verify educational content accessibility
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure fast lesson loading with SSG

### Performance Considerations
- Static generation of all lesson content for fast loading
- Optimize images within lesson content
- Minimize JavaScript for educational reading experience
- Ensure smooth navigation between lessons
