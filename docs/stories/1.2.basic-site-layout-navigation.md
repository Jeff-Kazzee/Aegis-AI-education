2. A site-wide footer component is created with basic information (e.g., copyright, links)
3. Both components are responsive and display cleanly on mobile and desktop screens

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 should have established the Next.js project structure with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and the proper component directory structure. The layout components will build upon this foundation.

### UI/UX Design Requirements
[Source: prd/user-interface-design-goals.md]
- **Overall UX Vision**: Prioritize clarity, accessibility, and trustworthiness; calm, educational, supportive space
- **Design Aesthetic**: Modern, clean, and professional; build trust and feel accessible
- **Navigation Paradigm**: Simple and predictable navigation, similar to well-designed blog or documentation site
- **Accessibility**: Must adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards for wide range of disabilities
- **Branding**: Simple color palette and highly readable typography
- **Responsive**: Must work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile web browsers

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/components.md]
- **WebApp (Next.js)**: Core user-facing application that handles page routing and renders UI components
- Header and Footer will be part of the WebApp's layout system

### Technology Stack for UI Development
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **UI Library**: React 18.x.x - Foundation of Next.js; industry standard for building interactive UIs
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.x - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid, consistent styling
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2.x - Provides layout.tsx for consistent page structure
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.4.x - Strong typing for component props and maintainability

### Project Structure for Components
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
Layout components must be placed in:
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── layout/          <- Header.tsx and Footer.tsx go here
│   └── ui/
```

And the main layout file is:
```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── layout.tsx       <- Where Header/Footer are integrated
```

### Navigation Requirements
Based on acceptance criteria and PRD, navigation must include:
- **"Home"** - Link to homepage (/)
- **"Course"** - Link to educational module page (/course)
- **"Posts"** - Link to Substack posts page (/posts)
- **"Support Us"** - Link to donation page (/support)

### Responsive Design Considerations
- Mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS responsive utilities
- Navigation should collapse or adapt appropriately on smaller screens
- Ensure touch targets are adequately sized for mobile interaction
- Typography should remain readable across all screen sizes

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Frameworks**: Jest 29.7.x and React Testing Library 15.0.x
- **Component Testing**: Focus on component behavior from user's perspective
- **Test Location**: Place tests in `/tests/` directory
- **Testing Requirements**: Test responsive behavior, accessibility, and navigation functionality

### Accessibility Requirements
- Use semantic HTML elements (nav, header, footer)
- Implement proper ARIA labels for navigation
- Ensure keyboard navigation works correctly
- Maintain proper color contrast ratios
- Include skip links for screen readers if needed
