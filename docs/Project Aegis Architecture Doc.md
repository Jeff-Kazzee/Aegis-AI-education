Project 'Aegis' Fullstack Architecture Document
Version: 1.0
Date: July 25, 2025
Author: Winston, Architect

Introduction
This document outlines the complete full-stack architecture for Project 'Aegis', including the backend systems (or lack thereof), frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack. This unified approach is ideal for a Next.js project where frontend and backend concerns are tightly integrated within the same framework.


Starter Template or Existing Project
Based on the PRD, this is a greenfield project. The technical assumptions clearly state the use of Next.js deployed on Vercel. This combination serves as our "starter template." Vercel's platform provides an out-of-the-box, production-grade foundation for Next.js applications, which includes the CI/CD pipeline, serverless function environment, and global CDN. This choice perfectly aligns with the non-functional requirement for a low-cost, easily maintainable system for a single developer (NFR2).

High Level Architecture
Technical Summary
Project 'Aegis' will be implemented as a 

serverless, statically-oriented web application using the Next.js framework, deployed on the Vercel platform. The architecture prioritizes performance, security, and extremely low operational overhead, making it ideal for a solo operator. Core educational content will be sourced from local Markdown files, enabling simple, git-based content management. Dynamic content, such as the latest posts, will be fetched from Substack's RSS feed via a serverless function, decoupling our platform from theirs. This approach directly supports the PRD goals of creating a trusted, hype-free, and financially self-sufficient educational resource.


Platform and Infrastructure Choice

Platform: Vercel is the chosen platform.

Key Services: We will leverage Vercel's native features, including:


Serverless Functions: For all backend logic, such as fetching the Substack feed.

Global CDN: For optimal performance and delivery of content worldwide.


CI/CD: Automated builds, testing, and deployments via GitHub integration.


Deployment Host and Regions: Vercel's global edge network will be used, with no specific region configuration required, simplifying management.

Repository Structure

Structure: A Monorepo structure will be used, as specified in the PRD's technical assumptions. This keeps all project code (frontend, serverless functions, content) in a single, manageable repository.

Architectural Patterns
Jamstack: The architecture is fundamentally Jamstack. We will serve a static, pre-rendered shell and client-side JavaScript that pulls in dynamic content from APIs. This pattern is key to achieving our high-performance goals (NFR1) and enhancing security by minimizing server-side processes.

Serverless: All backend logic is handled by on-demand, serverless functions. This directly fulfills the PRD's requirement (FR2, NFR2) for a "no traditional backend" architecture that is cost-effective and scales automatically.

slug: string - The URL-friendly identifier from the filename.

title: string - The lesson's title from the Markdown frontmatter.

order: number - A numeric value from the frontmatter for sequencing.

content: string - The main body of the lesson, parsed from Markdown into HTML.

excerpt: string - An optional summary from the frontmatter.

SubstackPost: Represents a single article fetched from the Substack publication's RSS feed.

title: string - The title of the post.

Components

WebApp (Next.js): The core, user-facing application that handles page routing and renders UI components.

Content Service (Local): A logical service responsible for reading and parsing lesson data from local Markdown files.


Substack Integration Service (Serverless Function): Encapsulates all logic for fetching and parsing the Substack RSS feed, exposing it via GET /api/posts.

Core Workflows
Workflow 1: User Views a Course Lesson
This workflow shows how static content is read and pre-rendered at build time for maximum performance.

Code snippet

sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant WebApp (Next.js)
    participant ContentService as Content Service (Local)

    User->>WebApp: Requests lesson page (e.g., /course/some-lesson)
    activate WebApp
    Note over WebApp,ContentService: This happens at build-time (SSG)
    WebApp->>ContentService: getLessonBySlug("some-lesson")
    activate ContentService
    ContentService-->>WebApp: Returns structured Lesson object
    deactivate ContentService
    WebApp-->>User: Serves pre-rendered HTML page
    deactivate WebApp


Workflow 2: User Views the Substack Posts Page
This workflow details fetching dynamic content via our internal serverless API.

Code snippet

sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant WebApp (Next.js)
    participant SubstackIntegrationService as Substack Service (/api/posts)
    participant SubstackRSS as Substack RSS Feed (External)

    User->>WebApp: Requests /posts page
    activate WebApp
    WebApp->>SubstackIntegrationService: GET /api/posts
    activate SubstackIntegrationService
    SubstackIntegrationService->>SubstackRSS: Fetches RSS Feed
    activate SubstackRSS
    SubstackRSS-->>SubstackIntegrationService: Returns RSS/XML Data
    deactivate SubstackRSS
    SubstackIntegrationService-->>WebApp: Returns parsed posts as JSON
    deactivate SubstackIntegrationService
    WebApp-->>User: Serves page with list of posts
    deactivate WebApp


Database Schema
For the MVP, there is no traditional database. This is a deliberate decision to align with the principles of simplicity and minimal operational overhead (NFR2). Content is persisted in the Git repository (lessons) and on the Substack platform (posts).


Unified Project Structure
This structure organizes the project into logical directories, separating code, content, and configuration.

Development Workflow
Local Development Setup
Prerequisites: Node.js 20.x (LTS) and npm 10.x.


Initial Setup: git clone <repo>, cd aegis-project, npm install.

Development Commands:

npm run dev: Starts the local dev server.

npm run test: Runs all unit tests.


npm run build: Creates a production build.

Environment Configuration
For the MVP, 

no local environment variables are required, simplifying the setup process.

Deployment Architecture
CI/CD Pipeline
The pipeline is fully automated as per the PRD.


Continuous Integration (CI): On every push, GitHub Actions runs npm run test to validate code quality.

Continuous Deployment (CD): Merges to the main branch are automatically built and deployed to production by Vercel. Pushes to other branches create unique Preview Deployments.

Security and Performance
Security: The MVP is secure by design due to a minimal attack surface (no database, no auth). All traffic is served over HTTPS, and dependencies are monitored.

Performance: The goal of a 90+ Lighthouse score (NFR1) is achieved through Static Site Generation (SSG) for lessons, Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for posts, automatic image optimization, and deployment to a global CDN.

Testing Strategy and Standards
The strategy focuses on automated unit tests to ensure reliability without high overhead.

Frameworks: Jest and React Testing Library.

Scope: The primary focus is on unit testing React components and library functions. E2E tests are out of scope for the MVP to maintain simplicity (NFR2).

Continuous Testing: All tests are run automatically via GitHub Actions on every push, preventing regressions.
