# Goals and Background Context

Goals:

To empower the working class with critical, model-agnostic AI literacy.

To provide a trusted, hype-free, and pro-labor alternative to mainstream AI education.

To foster a community of capable, future-ready workers and small business owners.

To build a financially self-sufficient platform that is sustainable for a single owner/operator.

Background Context:
The rapid advancement of AI presents a crisis for the working class, who face threats of job displacement and invasive algorithmic management. The current information ecosystem fails to address these threats, instead trapping users in algorithmic silos that profit from confirmation bias and hype. This project aims to fill the void left by this systemic failure by creating a trusted educational resource. It will provide the practical skills and critical thinking necessary for workers to navigate the AI transition with agency and power.
