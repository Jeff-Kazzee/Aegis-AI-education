# Next Steps

Architect Prompt:
Winston (Architect),

Here is the finalized Product Requirements Document and the foundational Project Brief for this vital mission. Our goal is to build an educational platform that empowers the working class with a pro-labor, anti-hype perspective on AI.

Your task is to design a full-stack architecture based on the technical assumptions and requirements detailed herein (Next.js, Vercel, Serverless, Monorepo). The architecture you create must be manageable by a solo operator, prioritizing simplicity, security, and low operational overhead. We need a foundation that is not only technically excellent but also embodies our core principles of empowerment and long-term sustainability.
