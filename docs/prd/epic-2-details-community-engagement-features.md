# Epic 2 Details: Community & Engagement Features

Expanded Goal: To build upon the successful MVP by adding user accounts and a community forum, transforming the platform from a content site into an interactive community hub where users can track progress and support each other.

User Stories:

Story 2.1: User Registration

As a new visitor, I want to create a secure account using my email and a password, so that I can access members-only content and community features.

Acceptance Criteria:

A registration page is created with fields for email and password.

Upon successful submission, a new user account is created in the system.

The user is automatically logged in and redirected to their new profile page.

Clear error messages are shown for invalid email formats, weak passwords, or if the email is already in use.

Story 2.2: User Login & Logout

As a registered user, I want to log in and out of the platform, so that I can securely manage my session.

Acceptance Criteria:

A login page is created with fields for email and password.

Upon successful login, the user is redirected to their profile page.

A clear error message is shown for incorrect credentials.

When a user is logged in, the main navigation includes a link to their profile and a logout button.

Clicking logout ends the user's session and redirects them to the homepage.

Story 2.3: Basic User Profile Page

As a logged-in user, I want a basic profile page, so that I can confirm I am logged in and have a central place for my account.

Acceptance Criteria:

A new page is created at a /profile route that is only accessible to logged-in users.

The page displays the user's registered email address.

The page includes the logout button.

Any visitor who is not logged in is redirected to the login page when attempting to access this route.

Story 2.4: Community Platform Access Page

As a logged-in user, I want to access a private community space, so that I can connect with other users.

Acceptance Criteria:

A new "Community" page is created that is only accessible to logged-in users.

The page contains information about the community and its rules.

A prominent button or link provides the invitation to join the designated private community platform (such as a Slack, Discord, or private Subreddit).

Visitors who are not logged in are redirected to the login page when attempting to access this route.
