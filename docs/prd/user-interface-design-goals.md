# User Interface Design Goals

Overall UX Vision:
The user experience will prioritize clarity, accessibility, and trustworthiness. It should feel like a calm, educational, and supportive space, free of the distracting patterns and "dark UX" common on the web. The design will be simple, respectful of the user's time, and heavily focused on readability.

Key Interaction Paradigms:
The platform will be a content-consumption experience, similar to a well-designed blog or documentation site. Navigation will be simple and predictable. Any interactive elements will be used purposefully to enhance learning, not for novelty.

Core Screens and Views (for MVP):

Homepage

Core Educational Module Page (with posts/lessons)

Substack Posts Page

Donation Page

Accessibility:
The site will adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards to ensure it is usable by people with a wide range of disabilities.

Branding:
The branding will aim for a modern, clean, and professional aesthetic. The goal is to build trust and feel accessible, avoiding any overly activist styling that might dissuade a broader audience. The focus will be on a simple color palette and highly readable typography.

Target Device and Platforms:
The platform will be a responsive website, designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile web browsers.
